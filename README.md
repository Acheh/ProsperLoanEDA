# Exploratory Data Analysis on Prosper Loan Dataset using R

Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that allows people to invest in each other by connecting investors and borrowers through its service. In this project, a Prosper Loan dataset from [udacity](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1525190034297000) that consists of more than 100,000 loans originated between 2006 and 2014 was explored using R and exploratory data analysis techniques to find trends and relationship in the data. I conducted this EDA with little to no knowledge about Prosper. Therefore, my EDA will focus on the get to know aspects of Prosper as a company (its history, borrower, and investor). I hope people who are new to peer-to-peer lending, either as a borrower or an investor, and want to know more about Prosper can benefit from this EDA. As products of this project, there are three final plots along with explanation about each plot depicting findings from the EDA.
